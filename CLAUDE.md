# Taproot POS — Claude Project State

> ## 🔍 Hour 1 Infra/Security Verification (2026-06-10) — see docs/HOUR1_REPORT.md
> No code changed. Live verification: API health ok (db/redis/stripe ok), both apps tsc 0,
> admin portal login/metrics/helpdesk all working, demo data clean (50 products page 1, 0 at
> $0; 16 categories). **Redis: ok** — `/api/health` timed ~2.5s cold≈warm because it's an
> uncached liveness probe pinging 3 services per call (not a cache benchmark).
> Env source-of-truth: `docs/ENV_CHECKLIST.md` (corrects the old template: JWT_REFRESH_SECRET
> doesn't exist; MFA_TOKEN_SECRET + MFA_ENCRYPTION_KEY are required; ADMIN_JWT_SECRET has a
> fallback). Jake TODOs: run docs/MIGRATIONS_CHECK.sql + docs/ADMIN_USER_CHECK.sql; rotate
> ADMIN_JWT_SECRET + Postgres password; confirm STRIPE key is sk_live_ before real payments.

> # ✅ Session 1 Complete (2026-06-09) — Executive/Helpdesk Portal backend
> Parallel-session scope (only owned files + append-only to index.ts/config.ts):
> - **docs/TECH_SPEC.md** — full product spec (v1.5.0), the helpdesk AI's knowledge base.
> - **migrations/022_admin_users.js** — admin_users, admin_sessions, admin_impersonation_log,
>   helpdesk_tickets, helpdesk_messages (+ seeded super admin with a REAL bcrypt-12 hash).
> - **apps/api/src/middleware/adminAuth.ts** — admin JWT auth (separate ADMIN_JWT_SECRET +
>   issuer/audience) with server-side admin_sessions revocation; `requireAdminRole`.
> - **apps/api/src/services/admin.service.ts** — admin login (lockout), org list/detail/update
>   (admin actions audit-logged as actor_type 'system' — the audit CHECK forbids 'admin'),
>   impersonation (1h org token + impersonation log), platform metrics.
> - **apps/api/src/services/helpdesk.service.ts** — Claude support assistant grounded ONLY in
>   TECH_SPEC.md (loaded once at startup), JSON answer + escalation tier; org-context fetch.
> - **apps/api/src/routes/admin.routes.ts** — all /api/v1/admin/* routes; registered in index.ts.
> - Adapted the spec's `db.query`/`import { db }` to the real `query` from `db/client`.
>
> ⚠️ **MIGRATION NEEDED** (Railway console): `npx node-pg-migrate up --migrations-dir migrations`
>   → applies **022_admin_users**.
> ⚠️ **ENV VAR NEEDED** (Railway): `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET=$(openssl rand -base64 32)` (falls back to
>   `${JWT_SECRET}_admin` if unset, but set it explicitly in prod).
>
> Admin login: `POST /api/v1/admin/auth/login` `{ email: 'admin@taproot-pos.com',
> password: 'TaprootAdmin2026!' }` — **CHANGE PASSWORD IMMEDIATELY** after first login.
> tsc: 0 errors both apps. Next: Session 3 builds the admin portal UI.

> # ✅ Session 3 Complete (2026-06-09) — Executive Admin Portal + Helpdesk UI
> Frontend-only scope (all new files under `apps/web/src/pages/admin/*` + `lib/adminApi.ts`
> + `store/adminAuth.store.ts`; `App.tsx` append-only admin routes). No backend touched.
> - **Admin login** at `/admin/login` — separate auth (`taproot_admin_token`/`taproot_admin_user`,
>   persist key `taproot-admin-auth`), no shared state with org auth.
> - **Dashboard** `/admin/dashboard` — 4 KPI cards, recent orgs, live service-health panel.
> - **Organizations** `/admin/organizations` — searchable/filterable/paginated table.
> - **Org detail** `/admin/organizations/:id` — Overview / Employees / Orders / Audit Log /
>   Settings tabs; edit modal (super_admin + support); impersonation modal (super_admin only,
>   reason required → applies 1h org token to localStorage + opens POS in a new tab).
> - **Helpdesk** `/admin/helpdesk` — two-column AI chat (org context + open tickets + spec-grounded
>   answers with escalation tiers, suggested-action chips, related docs).
> - **Metrics** `/admin/metrics` — Revenue / Growth / Usage / Health sections.
>
> ⚠️ **adminApi.ts NORMALIZES the backend payloads**: the admin endpoints return raw snake_case
>   Postgres rows with numeric aggregates as strings; the client maps snake_case→camelCase and
>   coerces numbers. Money stays in CENTS (format with `fmtCurrency`). The prompt's literal
>   camelCase response types did NOT match the backend — normalization layer bridges them.
> ⚠️ Employee reset/deactivate + a dedicated orders endpoint are NOT in the admin API yet; those
>   UI areas show available data + a note instead of calling nonexistent endpoints.
>
> Admin credentials (after migration 022 runs on Railway):
> URL: taproot-pos.com/admin/login · Email: admin@taproot-pos.com · Password: TaprootAdmin2026!
> ⚠️ **TODO — change admin password immediately** (Railway console):
> `UPDATE admin_users SET password_hash = <new bcrypt cost-12 hash> WHERE email = 'admin@taproot-pos.com';`
> ⚠️ Live admin login stays 401 until **migration 022** is applied on Railway
>   (`npx node-pg-migrate up --migrations-dir migrations`) and `ADMIN_JWT_SECRET` is set.
> tsc: 0 errors both apps; `vite build` clean.

>
> Good morning Jake. Sprint 10 is done. Your product is ready to launch. The only thing
> between you and your first customer is a conversation. Go have it. 🌿
>
> **Sprint 10 (Launch Polish) — frontend/docs only, ran alongside Sprint 9 AI with no file
> collisions:** production landing page (13 sections, $99 GTM, savings calculator, FAQ accordion,
> demo modal); split-screen login/register (all auth logic preserved); SVG favicon + OG image +
> SEO/social meta tags; error-page support contact + login analytics; production README +
> docs/ONBOARDING.md; V1.3 launch kit in docs/LAUNCH.md. **tsc 0 errors both apps; web build green.**
>
> **Pending actions for Jake:**
> 1. Run pending migrations in Railway: `npx node-pg-migrate up --migrations-dir migrations`
> 2. Set up Plausible Analytics — add site taproot-pos.com (script already in index.html).
> 3. Record the 60-second demo video (the hero "Watch demo" opens a placeholder modal for now).
> 4. Review docs/LAUNCH.md → post to Product Hunt + Reddit, send outreach, walk into 3 restaurants.
> 5. Replace the demo org's placeholder menu prices with real prices when convenient.

> # ✅ BUG-IMP-004 RESOLVED (2026-06-07)
> Menu (PDF) **and** CSV imports now append products to the POS correctly. Root cause:
> `applyMenuImport`/`applyGenericCsvImport` did a manual `product_variants` INSERT that omitted the
> NOT NULL `organization_id`, so every item threw (caught → counted "failed") and products were left
> priceless — the same priceless-products symptom seen in the perfection pass. Fix: pass `price` to
> `createProduct` (which creates the variant + price WITH org_id) and delete the broken manual insert
> in both functions; `ImportReview` now invalidates the `['products']`/`['categories']` caches so the
> POS shows imported items immediately.

> # ✅ COMPREHENSIVE FIX PASS (2026-06-07 pt3)
>
> Lookback green (health ok, tsc 0 both apps). Worked the priority list:
> - **Auth** ✅ live: login 200+token, register 201+token (BUG-AUTH-002 stays RESOLVED).
> - **Import** ✅ BUG-IMP-004 fixed + live-verified (CSV upload→confirm→product with price).
> - **Payment** ✅ BUG-PAY-001 modifier `?? []` guards confirmed present.
> - **BUG-SCHED-001 FIXED** ✅ — `GET /schedules` 500'd (Postgres 42883: `to_char(timetz)` has no
>   overload). Now slices "HH:MM" via `substring(col::text,1,5)`. This proves **migration 021 IS
>   applied** (schedules/time_clock tables exist) — the "pending" banner above is stale for 021.
> - **SEC-ORG-001 PARTIAL** — added `AND organization_id=$org` to the 3 documented by-UUID lookups
>   (order→customer, inventory→product, receipt→employee). Remaining low-risk lookups noted in BACKLOG.
> - **Feature Verification Audit — 15/15 working** (live): tables, public menu, kitchen, loyalty,
>   gift cards, AI forecast, analytics (menu-engineering + menu-insights), api-keys, webhooks,
>   reservations, cash-drawer, end-of-day (needs `date=`), locations, schedules (post-fix). No broken
>   features remained → nothing else for Priority 7.
> - **Scroll** ✅ verified on InventoryPage / ImportReview / OrderHistoryPage (fixed-shell +
>   `overflow-y-auto min-h-0`; sticky theads on Order History).
> - **Demo data** — already priced 50/50 (perfection pass); `docs/DEMO_DATA_FIX.sql` is a safe
>   diagnostic + guarded archive (no blind delete) in case $0 items reappear.
> - **BUG-IMP-005** (sub-$1 price normalization) stays OPEN (minor).
>
> 12-step new-owner flow: all steps verified working at the API level. tsc 0 both apps.

> # 🌿 SPRINT 11 — "Perfect Product" pass (2026-06-07) — v1.5.0 (PARTIAL, honest)
>
> **Scope honesty:** the browser-dependent audits (visual walkthroughs, 375px mobile sizing,
> Lighthouse, network-throttle, click-through of every screen) were NOT run — there is no browser
> in the build environment. Claiming "all 14 audits passed" would be false. What WAS done:
> - **BUG-IMP-005 RESOLVED** — `normalizeMenuPrice` no longer corrupts sub-$1 prices / modifier
>   deltas (e.g. +$0.75 = 75 was becoming $75). Trusts integer cents; ×100 only for decimals/$-strings;
>   preserves negative deltas. Parser prompt strengthened with explicit cents examples.
> - **Performance (live):** server fast; latency is Railway-RTT-dominated (health ~380ms from here);
>   products 495 / categories 614 / orders 367 / business 289 ms. No N+1 fixes needed.
> - **Static checks:** 0 console.log in web prod; no raw HTTP/undefined/null strings shown to users;
>   2 TODOs, both known P3 (ArchivedProducts permanent-delete; LoginPage MFA = BUG-QA-011).
>   tsc 0 both apps; web build green. Feature audit (pt3): 15/15 API endpoints working.
> - **STILL NEEDS A REAL-DEVICE QA PASS** before claiming "perfect": Audits 1,3,4,5,6,7,8,10,12
>   (visual/interaction) + Lighthouse. Recommended on an iPad + phone before first customer.

> # ✅ ADMIN BACKEND COMPLETE & LIVE (2026-06-09)
> The executive-portal backend (built+committed in c1cbc77: admin.routes / admin.service /
> helpdesk.service / adminAuth middleware / migration 022) was present but BLOCKED by two
> integration gaps, both fixed in `7656e29` (index.ts only):
> 1. The global org-auth preHandler caught every `/api/v1/admin/*` route (login → 401). Admin
>    routes use a SEPARATE admin JWT and self-authenticate via `authenticateAdmin`; they're now
>    exempted from the org-auth + subscription guard.
> 2. `seedFirstAdminUser` was never wired — added an idempotent startup seed (resilient if
>    migration 022 isn't applied).
> - **Verified LIVE:** `POST /api/v1/admin/auth/login` (admin@taproot-pos.com / TaprootAdmin2026!)
>   → 200 + accessToken (role super_admin). `/admin/metrics`, `/admin/organizations`,
>   `/admin/helpdesk/tickets` → 200 with token; → 401 without. Migration 022 was already applied
>   on Railway, so the startup seed created the admin user automatically.
> - ⚠️ CHANGE THE DEFAULT ADMIN PASSWORD. Session 3 (admin UI) can proceed.

> # ✅ Session 2 (2026-06-09) — account workflow test + backlog clearance
> - **New-account workflow: 8/8 PASS** (live) — register → login → empty products → create product
>   → correct price → order → cash payment → receipt. See docs/ACCOUNT_WORKFLOW_TEST.md. No app bugs;
>   the only initial failures were test-payload omissions (register needs businessName/businessType;
>   POST /products needs locationId in body — both correct app behavior).
> - **Bugs:** no P0/P1 OPEN. Reconciled stale BUG-IMP-005 → RESOLVED. Remaining are P3/low/enh:
>   QA-011 (MFA UI — feature, no MFA accounts), QA-014 (top-customers — demo seed data, report code
>   correct), SEC-ORG-001 (low, 3/~11 done), ENH-WH-001 (enhancement). tsc 0 both apps.
> - Respected parallel-session no-touch list (admin/helpdesk/022/TECH_SPEC).

## ✅ SPRINT 9 — AI Intelligence Layer (COMPLETE, v1.2.0)

### S9-01 — AI Demand Forecasting ✅ COMPLETE
- `aiForecast.service.ts` (new — services/forecast.service.ts is the Prompt-04 INVENTORY
  forecaster, hence the name): `getForecast(orgId, loc, date, tz)` — 90d history grouped by
  DOW (avg revenue/orders, top-10 items per DOW, last7-vs-last30 trend) → Claude JSON
  (predictedRevenue low/mid/high CENTS, predictedOrders, predictedTopItems, 3-5 prep recs,
  confidence) with full shape validation; statistical fallback (±20% band, confidence ≤0.5,
  note "Statistical estimate") when no key / <7 days history / bad AI output. Redis cache
  `ai:forecast:{org}:{loc}:{date}` 4h.
- `ai.routes.ts`: GET `/api/v1/ai/forecast?date&locationId&timezone` (AI_COPILOT).
- Web: `ai.forecast()` client + `components/ai/ForecastWidget.tsx` — date selector
  (tomorrow +2), confidence line, revenue range + likely bar, ~orders, top-seller prep
  quantities, prep checklist card; loading skeleton + "AI insights temporarily unavailable"
  error state. Mounted at top of /reports above NLQueryBar.

### S9-02 — AI Staff Scheduling + Time Clock ✅ COMPLETE
- `migrations/021_time_clock.js` ⚠️ PENDING: time_clock_entries (clock in/out, break_minutes,
  hours_worked, hourly_rate, labor_cost — rate/cost in DOLLARS to match employees.hourly_rate;
  cents at API boundary) + schedules (shift_date/timetz start+end, role, ai_suggested) + indexes.
- `scheduling.service.ts` (new, `timeClockReady()` resilient): clockIn (one open entry guard)/
  clockOut (hours + labor computed in SQL)/getCurrentEntry/getTimeClockReport;
  listSchedules/saveWeekSchedule (whole-week replace, HH:MM validation); `getAIScheduleSuggestion`
  — S5 staffing plan + roster → Claude JSON shifts (validated: roster ids, in-week dates, HH:MM)
  w/ deterministic round-robin fallback; labor% = shift hours × employee rates vs forecast revenue.
  Cache `ai:schedule:{org}:{loc}:{week}` 4h.
- `scheduling.routes.ts` (new, registered): POST /timeclock/clockin|clockout (self), GET
  /timeclock/current, GET /timeclock/report (mgr), GET/POST /schedules (GET any, POST mgr),
  GET /ai/schedule-suggestion (mgr).
- Web: timeclock/schedules clients; `SchedulePage.tsx` (/schedule, mgr/owner nav-gated) — week
  nav, employees × Mon-Sun grid w/ shift chips (AI ones tinted), add-shift modal, remove, live
  labor tracker (green<30/amber≤35/red), ✨ AI suggest → draft preview → "Apply AI Schedule"
  (saves week); EmployeeSelect post-PIN choice [Clock In + Start Shift] / [Just Login];
  POSLayout `ClockOutButton` in top bar (hidden pre-migration via null /timeclock/current).
- NOTE: drag-to-move/resize shifts deferred (add/remove + AI apply shipped).

### S9-03 — AI Menu Engineering Recommendations ✅ COMPLETE
- `analytics.service.getMenuInsights` (new): S8 matrix + avg sell price per item → Claude JSON
  per-item {recommendation, suggestedAction promote|reprice|reposition|archive|none,
  suggestedPrice cents|null} + 2-3 sentence narrative + 3 quickWins (validated, merged by
  productId). Deterministic fallback (quadrant→action map, generated quick wins). Cache
  `ai:menu-insights:{org}:{loc}:{fromDay}:{toDay}` 4h.
- `analytics.routes.ts`: GET /api/v1/analytics/menu-insights (REPORTS_VIEW).
- Web: `analytics.menuInsights` client + MenuTab rework — AI assessment box, 3 quick-win cards
  w/ live action buttons (archive → real archive; reprice → prompt prefilled w/ suggested price
  → products.update; promote/reposition → guidance toast), AI-rec column color-coded by action,
  per-row one-click action, detail card uses aiRecommendation + action button.

### S9-04 — Daily Intelligence Feed (owner dashboard) ✅ COMPLETE
- `intelligence.service.getDailyIntelligence` (new): yesterday (revenue + % vs same weekday last
  week, orders, avg ticket, best/worst item, voids count+$, cash discrepancy from latest closed
  drawer session — try/catch resilient), today (single-date AI forecast low/high/orders + prep
  checklist via aiForecast, staffScheduled from schedules table [0 pre-021] vs staffRecommended
  from staffing plan), alerts (≥3 voids, drawer off, low stock ETAs, understaffed, no-sales,
  clean-reconcile success), reorderNeeded w/ daysUntilStockout (on-hand ÷ 14d daily usage),
  ONE AI insight sentence (deterministic trend fallback). Cache `ai:daily-intel:{org}:{loc}:{day}` 1h.
- `ai.routes.ts`: GET /api/v1/ai/daily-intelligence (AI_COPILOT).
- Web: `ai.dailyIntelligence` client; `components/ai/IntelligenceFeed.tsx` — greeting, green AI
  insight card, yesterday cards (↑/↓ vs last week), today outlook (forecast range + staffing ✅),
  alert cards, prep checklist, reorder ETAs, big "Start taking orders →" button.
- POSLayout: feed is the LANDING VIEW for owner/manager (canAccessSettings) until dismissed —
  dismissal sticks per-day per-tab (sessionStorage taproot_feed_dismissed). Cashiers go straight
  to tiles. Search/table-mode/items view bypass the feed; POS always one tap away.
- NOTE: 7am email digest cron deferred (spec optional) — endpoint is poll-ready for it.

### S9-05 — Recipe-Based Food Cost Intelligence ✅ COMPLETE
- `foodCost.service.ts` (new — distinct from S5-04's line-item COGS view): theoretical PLATE
  COST per product from active recipes (Σ qty × (1+waste_factor) × ingredient cost_price ÷
  yield_factor); products without recipes fall back to their own cost_price (flagged "no recipe").
  Status by org target (organizations.settings.foodCostTargetPct, default 30): healthy ≤ target,
  warning ≤ +8, critical above. ONE batched Claude call writes fix suggestions for flagged items
  (price/portion/substitution w/ numbers) + deterministic price-for-target fallback. 4h cache.
- `getFoodCostSummary`: blended actual food cost (30d sales mix), variance vs target, items over,
  potential monthly savings (flagged items' 30d revenue × pct gap), top offenders, 90d weekly trend.
- Routes: GET /api/v1/analytics/food-cost (+/summary) — REPORTS_VIEW.
- Web: analytics.foodCost/foodCostSummary clients; Analytics "Food Cost" tab — summary KPIs,
  90d trend line w/ dashed target ReferenceLine, items table (sale/plate/% /status), "Fix →"
  modal (AI suggestion + one-click raise-price-to-target via products.update, recipe-edit hint).
- ProductsSettingsPage: "Ingredient cost" $ field (→ products.cost_price cents; recipe overrides);
  sent only when non-empty; create path applies via follow-up update.

### S9-06 — Enhanced AI Copilot ✅ COMPLETE
- `ai.routes.ts`: GET /api/v1/ai/suggested-questions (AI_REPORTS) — context-aware chips seasoned
  with live data (busiest day → "When is my busiest hour on Xs?", top employee, low-stock → "What
  should I 86…"), 1h cached, static fallback. nl-query now returns validated `suggestedAction`
  {label, action: view_orders|view_employee|archive_product|update_price, params} (prompt + parse).
- Web: `ai.suggestedQuestions` client; NLQueryResponse.suggestedAction type. InsightsPage Copilot:
  server-fetched starter chips, action button on answers (navigates to /orders, /analytics, or
  /settings/products), Copy button per answer, Export CSV when tabular data present, Clear
  conversation. Existing chart/table rendering (S5-06) retained.

## ✅ PERFECTION PASS (2026-06-07) — 10-step new-owner flow verified live

Audited the live stack (curl against prod) against the 10-step new-owner journey
(landing → register → import menu → correct prices → edit → confirm → POS →
cart+modifiers → cash payment → receipt → still-logged-in-tomorrow). **All green.**

- Landing `taproot-pos.com` → 200; `/api/health` → ok (db/redis/stripe ok).
- Demo login → accessToken. Registration → accessToken. **Note:** the register
  body fields are `businessName` + `businessType` — `organizationName` is NOT a
  field (a payload with it 400s; the app sends the right fields).
- `GET /products` → 50 items, **all now priced** (fix below).
- `tsc --noEmit` → **0 errors** in apps/web AND apps/api.
- End-to-end Flow 1 (create order → cash payment → receipt) → **201/201/200, no
  crash**; receipt renders full data for org "Haven Health Bar".
- All page-backing endpoints (products/orders/employees/business/reports/kitchen/
  categories/customers) → 200; SPA serves /, /login, /register, /pos.

**Fix applied this pass (data-only, no repo code change):** the demo org had 32
products with **no price** (a prior menu-import that came in at $0; the org is a
health café, so these ARE the intended menu). Assigned placeholder café prices via
`PATCH /products/:id` — `updateProduct` auto-creates a Default variant + price row
when missing. Now **50/50 products priced**; demo POS shows no $0 items.

**Verified already-resolved (code review):** BUG-PAY-001 (`(c.modifiers ?? [])`
guards present), login redirect cycle (App `useLocation()` + apiFetch auto-refresh),
global scroll fix, import price path (prompt forces integer cents + create inserts
when price>0).

**Known minor (not blocking, logged in BACKLOG):** `normalizeMenuPrice` treats any
value `<100` as dollars, so a genuine sub-$1 price (e.g. 99¢) would be 100×'d — rare.
Migrations 017/018/019 (Sprint 8: franchise/api-keys/allergens) pending on Railway —
graceful guards, unrelated to the 10-step flow.

**Status: ready for first real customer.**

## 🏗️ SPRINT 8 — Enterprise Foundations (IN PROGRESS, target v1.1.0)

### S8-01 — Franchise Mode ✅ COMPLETE
- `migrations/017_franchise.js` ⚠️ PENDING: organizations.parent_org_id/org_type/franchise_code
  (+ partial unique idx on code) and products.corporate_source_id (franchisee copies of pushed items).
- `franchise.service.ts` (new): info/enable(code gen FR-XXXXXXXX)/network(30d revenue+orders per
  franchisee)/invite(email w/ code)/join(guards: self/already-linked/franchisor)/corporate menu/
  pushMenu (upsert into each franchisee via product.service, marks corporate_source_id, un-archives
  on re-push). ALL entry points check `franchiseReady()` (information_schema, cached) → graceful
  when 017 pending.
- `product.service.ts`: local `corporateLockCheck` in archive+delete (franchisee + corporate item →
  Conflict). Local (not imported from franchise.service) to avoid circular import.
- `franchise.routes.ts` (new, registered): GET info/network/menu, POST enable/invite/join,
  PATCH menu/push. Owner for enable/join; owner/manager for network/invite/push.
  (Spec said settings.routes.ts; dedicated file matches the one-domain-one-file pattern.)
- `email.service.ts`: `sendFranchiseInviteEmail` (code + join steps; dev logs via jsonTransport).
- Web: `api.ts` `franchise.*` client + types; `FranchisePage.tsx` (/franchise — franchisor dashboard
  w/ network stats + cards + invite + push-menu modals; franchisee view w/ 🔒 corporate items;
  independent explainer); `FranchiseSettingsPage.tsx` (/settings/franchise — enable + code copy,
  join with code, brand-standards stub "coming soon"); POSLayout sidebar "Franchise" item (only
  when org_type=franchisor, via /franchise/info query); SettingsLayout nav item.
- NOTE: lock icons on /settings/products for corporate items deferred (delete/archive is blocked
  server-side with a clear message); brand standards PDF upload deferred (no asset storage).

### S8-02 — Customer Facing Display ✅ COMPLETE
- `lib/displayChannel.ts` (new): BroadcastChannel bridge ('taproot-customer-display') — types,
  `broadcastToDisplay`/`listenToDisplay`, `initDisplayBroadcast()` (idempotent pos.store
  subscription: cart/discount change → cart_update|idle; lastCompletedOrder null→order →
  payment_complete; answers `request_state` so a late-opened display syncs), `openCustomerDisplay()`.
  No-ops without BroadcastChannel support. NO server/backend involved.
- `CustomerDisplayPage.tsx` (new, `/display`, NO auth): green-gradient full-screen — idle (logo,
  org name, clock, rotating marketing messages incl. custom idle msg from localStorage
  `taproot_display_idle_message`), live cart (items+modifier sublines, subtotal/discount/tax/TOTAL),
  payment-complete (✓ THANK YOU, change due for cash, auto-idle after 5s).
- POSLayout: `initDisplayBroadcast()` effect + 📺 top-bar button (MonitorSmartphone icon).
- HardwareSettingsPage: "Customer display" section — idle-message input (localStorage), open
  display window + preview buttons. Logo upload deferred (no asset storage).

### S8-03 — Advanced Analytics Dashboard ✅ COMPLETE
- `analytics.service.ts` (new): `getCohortAnalysis` (signup-month cohorts × M1/M2/M3/M6 retention %),
  `getMenuEngineeringMatrix` (custom range; units/revenue/foodCost%/margin → star/plow_horse/puzzle/dog
  + per-quadrant recommendation), `getStaffPerformance` (orders/revenue/avgTicket/tips/voidRate;
  hoursWorked=null — NO time-clock table yet, documented), `getPeakHours` (7×24 revenue heatmap,
  intensity normalized, peak/slowest day+hour ignoring closed hours), `getCustomerInsights`
  (new vs returning [EXISTS prior order], churn risk >30d by LTV, top customers).
- `analytics.routes.ts` (new, registered): GET /analytics/{cohort,menu-engineering,staff-performance,
  peak-hours,customer-insights} — REPORTS_VIEW; from/to default last 30d.
- Web: `api.ts` `analytics.*` client + types; `AnalyticsPage.tsx` (/analytics) — 5 tabs:
  Overview (KPIs incl. repeat rate, revenue trend line 30/60/90d, top-5, deterministic quick
  insights from peak+menu data), Menu Engineering (recharts scatter w/ quadrant colors, click→
  recommendation card, one-click ARCHIVE for dogs — real products.archive; sortable table),
  Staff (top-performer banner, revenue bars, void-rate red flag >3%), Customers (cohort retention
  grid, churn list w/ mailto reach-out, new-vs-returning donut, top customers), Peak Hours
  (7×24 CSS-grid heatmap + staffing recommendation).
- POSLayout: Analytics nav item (manager/owner only via canAccessSettings). Route in App.tsx.

### S8-04 — Public API Keys + Webhooks ✅ COMPLETE
- `migrations/018_api_keys.js` ⚠️ PENDING: api_keys (sha256 key_hash unique, scopes[], expiry,
  revoked_at) + webhooks (url, events[], HMAC secret, failure_count, is_active).
- `apiKey.service.ts` (new): create (`taproot_live_` + 32 chars, full key returned ONCE, sha256
  stored)/list/revoke + `resolveApiKey()` → synthetic AccessTokenPayload (role 'readonly';
  capability via SCOPE_MAP: orders|products|customers:read/write + reports:read → internal
  Permission strings; locationIds=[] = all). Fire-forget last_used_at stamp.
- `auth/middleware.ts`: `authenticate` now routes Bearer `taproot_live_*` through resolveApiKey
  (401 on invalid/revoked/expired) — API keys hit the same /api/v1 endpoints.
- `webhook.service.ts` (new — OUTBOUND; routes/webhook.routes.ts stays INBOUND Stripe):
  list/create (whsec_ secret shown once)/delete/test + `deliverWebhook(orgId,event,payload)` —
  HMAC-SHA256 X-Taproot-Signature/-Event/-Delivery headers, 3 attempts (1s/3s backoff, 10s
  timeout), failure_count++ (reset on success), auto-disable at 10. NEVER throws; no-ops while
  018 pending.
- Events wired: payment.completed + order.completed (payment.service processPayment),
  order.voided (transaction.voidOrder), payment.refunded (transaction.refundOrder),
  customer.created (customer.service). `inventory.low_stock` is an allowed event type but not
  yet emitted (no low-stock event source hook) — documented.
- `apiKeys.routes.ts` + `webhooks.routes.ts` (new, registered): /api-keys CRUD + /webhooks CRUD
  + /:id/test. Owner/manager JWT sessions only (API keys can't manage API keys). No routing
  conflict with /webhooks/stripe/* (static segments win).
- Web: `api.ts` apiKeys/webhooksApi clients; `ApiSettingsPage.tsx` (/settings/api) — API Keys tab
  (create modal w/ scope checkboxes + expiry, show-key-ONCE modal w/ copy + confirm checkbox,
  revoke) + Webhooks tab (add modal w/ event checkboxes, secret-shown-once, test button,
  failure-count badge, active/disabled pill). Settings nav "API & Webhooks".

### S8-05 — Food Allergen System ✅ COMPLETE
- `migrations/019_allergens.js` ⚠️ PENDING: products.allergens varchar(50)[] + allergen_notes text
  (GIN idx) + customers.allergens. Values = FDA Big 9 (milk/eggs/fish/shellfish/tree_nuts/peanuts/
  wheat/soybeans/sesame).
- `product.service.ts`: UpdateProductData.allergens/allergenNotes — sanitized to Big 9; clear
  ValidationError when 019 pending (column-existence guard). `SELECT p.*` → list/get include
  allergens automatically post-migration. `customer.service.ts`: UpdateCustomerInput.allergens —
  separate guarded UPDATE. Shared `Product`/`Customer` types get optional allergens fields.
- `lib/allergens.ts` (web, new): FDA_ALLERGENS + labels, `allergenConflicts()`,
  ALLERGEN_NOTE_PREFIX ('⚠ ALLERGEN') + `buildAllergenNote()`.
- POSLayout: customer-detail query when a customer is attached; `handleProductTap`/LongPress run
  the conflict check FIRST → red Allergen Alert modal ("[name] has a [x] allergy / [product]
  contains [x]" → Remove | Add anyway — customer confirmed). Fast-path adds carry the allergen
  note in CartItem.notes → red ⚠ icon on the cart line → flows to order line_items.notes →
  KDS shows it as specialInstructions. PaymentSheet receipt snapshot appends the note as a
  modifier sub-line so browser/thermal kitchen tickets + receipts print it.
- ProductsSettingsPage modal: Allergens checkbox grid (Big 9) + kitchen notes field — only sent
  when touched (saves keep working pre-019); create path applies allergens via follow-up update.
- CustomersPage modal: "Allergens on file" checkbox grid (same touched-only rule).
- NOTE: "Add anyway" on items WITH modifier groups proceeds to the ModifierSheet — the kitchen
  note isn't auto-attached on that path (cashier can type it in the sheet's notes); top-of-ticket
  banner deferred in favor of per-item ⚠ sub-lines.

### S8-06 — Performance Optimization ✅ COMPLETE
- `migrations/020_performance_indexes.js` ⚠️ PENDING: composites on products(org,deleted,archived),
  orders(org,location,created), order_line_items(product,created), customers(org,deleted,tier),
  inventory_levels(org,location,product).
- `lib/cache.ts` (api, new): `getCached(key,ttl,fetchFn)` best-effort read-through +
  `invalidatePrefix` (SCAN+DEL) + `invalidateOrgCache(orgId,domains)`. Keys `org:{id}:{domain}[:variant]`.
- Cached 5 min: GET /categories (per org), GET /products (per sorted filter variant),
  GET /reports/sales (per from/to/loc/granularity/tz).
- Invalidation: product create/update/delete/archive/restore + category create/update/delete/
  reorder → products+categories (covers franchise pushes); order completion → reports.
- Web: queryClient staleTime 2m / gcTime 10m / retry 2; React.lazy + Suspense(PageSkeleton)
  for Reports/Analytics/DashboardEditor/FloorPlan pages → separate chunks (47/23/12/8 kB).
- Verified: vite build green w/ 4 lazy chunks; live /products ~0.5s (RTT-bound; Redis cache
  effective post-deploy). EXPLAIN ANALYZE on Railway = Jake (console-only access); 020 should
  flip the org-products seq scan to an index scan.
- NOTE: no product images in the UI yet → loading="lazy" n/a.

## ✅ Sprint 4 — Beta 1.4: Online Ordering & Engagement (COMPLETE)

### S4-01 — Online Checkout + Stripe ✅ COMPLETE
- `public.service.ts`: getPublicMenu now returns `online` block (enabled/pickup/delivery/fees/
  minOrder/prepMinutes + `paymentAvailable` = connected Stripe acct + STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY).
  createPublicOrder accepts fulfillmentType/address/requestedTime (stored in metadata+notes),
  honors `enabled`. New `createOnlinePaymentIntent` (Connect direct charge w/ application fee) +
  `confirmOnlinePayment` (verifies PI, records payment, completes order).
- `public.routes.ts`: POST `/public/:slug/payment-intent`, POST `/public/:slug/order/:id/confirm`
  (added to PUBLIC_ROUTES). 
- `api.ts`: `publicApi.paymentIntent/confirmPayment`, `online` on PublicMenu, `PublicOrderBody`.
- `PublicMenuPage`: pickup/delivery toggle + address, delivery fee + min-order, pay-at-counter
  (always) + "Pay now with card" (only when paymentAvailable). `OnlinePaymentSheet.tsx` (new) —
  Stripe Elements on the connected account.
- NOTE: card path requires Stripe Connect + STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY — UNTESTED on demo (no Connect);
  pay-at-counter is the verified path. @stripe/stripe-js + react-stripe-js already installed.

### S4-02 — Online Ordering Settings ✅ COMPLETE
- `settings.routes.ts`: GET/PATCH `/settings/online-ordering` (org settings.onlineOrdering:
  enabled/pickup/delivery/prepMinutes/radius/feeCents/minOrderCents). Public menu already reads it.
- `api.ts`: `settings.getOnlineOrdering/saveOnlineOrdering` + `OnlineOrderingConfig`.
- `OnlineOrderingSettingsPage.tsx` (new, `/settings/online-ordering`): toggles + prep/min/radius/fee.
  Online Ordering nav item.

### S4-03 — Loyalty Program ✅ COMPLETE
- `loyalty.service.ts`: was dead code reading a non-existent `loyalty_config` column —
  rewired to `organizations.settings.loyalty` (enabled/pointsPerDollar/redeemRate/minimumRedemption/
  tiers). Configurable tier thresholds.
- **Automatic accrual:** `payment.service.processPayment` awards points when an order is paid in
  full AND has a customer attached (non-fatal, never blocks payment).
- `settings.routes.ts`: GET/PATCH `/settings/loyalty`. `customer.routes.ts`: POST
  `/customers/:id/loyalty/adjust` (manual). `api.ts`: `settings.getLoyalty/saveLoyalty` + type.
- `LoyaltySettingsPage.tsx` (new, `/settings/loyalty`): earn/redeem rates + tier thresholds. Nav item.
- NOTE: redeem-at-checkout UI in PaymentSheet DEFERRED (POS payment flow is sacred); redeemPoints +
  manual adjust are available programmatically. Points/tier shown on the customer record (S4-06).

### S4-04 — Gift Cards ✅ COMPLETE
- Backend already complete (giftcard.service + /gift-cards routes; processPayment gift_card method
  validates + DEDUCTS balance + logs gift_card_transactions, refund restores). No backend change.
- `api.ts`: `giftCards.list/lookup/issue/reload/deactivate` + `GiftCardRow`.
- `GiftCardsSettingsPage.tsx` (new, `/settings/gift-cards`): issue (sell), list w/ balances, lookup
  by code, copy, deactivate. Nav item.
- `PaymentSheet`: gift_card method now shows a code-entry sub-flow and passes `giftCardCode` →
  real balance redemption at the POS.
- NOTE: selling a gift card as a cart line item deferred (issued via settings/admin instead);
  digital email delivery is a stub.

### S4-05 — Discount Code Engine ✅ COMPLETE
- `discount.service.ts` + `discount.routes.ts` (new, registered): list/create/update/delete +
  `validate` (active window/usage/min-order, computes savings, matches order.service value
  semantics: percentage=percent#, fixed=cents) + `report` (usage + total_saved from applied_discounts).
  Uses the existing `discounts` table (001).
- `api.ts`: `discounts.list/report/create/update/remove/validate` + types; `discountCodes` on
  OrderCreateBody + transform.
- `pos.store`: `appliedDiscount` {code, amount} + `setAppliedDiscount`; `discountTotal` now real
  (was placeholder 0); persisted + cleared on clearCart. tax computed on (subtotal − discount).
- `POSLayout`: "Add discount" prompts a code → validates → applies (toggles to "Remove"); cart
  preview + charged total both correct. PaymentSheet + SplitCheckModal send `discountCodes`.
- `DiscountsSettingsPage.tsx` (new, `/settings/discounts`): CRUD (%, fixed, BOGO, free item),
  min-order/usage-limit/active-until/stackable, redemption report column. Discounts nav item.
- NOTE: bogo/free_item preview shows base value (computed precisely server-side at order creation).

### S4-06 — Customer Management ✅ COMPLETE
- Backend already complete (customer.service + routes: list/search/create/get/patch/delete/orders/
  merge/credit + loyalty/adjust from S4-03). No backend change.
- `api.ts`: `customers.list/update/remove/orders/adjustLoyalty` (+ create tags/notes).
- `CustomersPage.tsx` (new, `/customers`): searchable list (name/contact/LTV/visits/points/tier/tags),
  CSV export, profile drawer (stats, recent orders, edit, ±points), create/edit modal. Customers nav item.
- `CustomerSearch.tsx`: **BUG-QA-012 resolved** — "Create new customer" now creates inline from the
  query (email/phone/name heuristic) and attaches to the cart.

## ✅ Sprint 5 — Beta 1.5: AI Intelligence Layer (COMPLETE)

Pattern: every feature computes deterministic numbers from SQL, then layers an optional Claude
narrative (`aiUsed` flag). `ai.service.ts` (new): `askClaudeJSON`/`askClaudeText` (graceful null on
no-key/parse/API failure, mirrors ai.routes pattern — `new Anthropic`, `config.CLAUDE_MODEL`) +
Redis `cacheGet/cacheSet`. All features degrade gracefully without ANTHROPIC_API_KEY.

### S5-01 — Demand Forecasting Engine ✅ COMPLETE
- `intelligence.service.ts` (new): `getDemandForecast` — 56-day history → day-of-week averaged
  7-day forecast (confidence by sample size) + Claude narrative; **cached 4h in Redis**.
- `intelligence.routes.ts` (new, registered): `GET /intelligence/forecast` (REPORTS_VIEW).
- `api.ts`: `intelligence.forecast` + `DemandForecast`. `InsightsPage.tsx` (new, `/insights`):
  tabbed AI dashboard, Forecast tab (narrative + bar chart + detail table). Insights nav item.

### S5-02 — AI Staff Scheduling ✅ COMPLETE
- `intelligence.service.getStaffingPlan`: forecast → recommended staff (sales/$900-per-shift),
  labor cost (avg `employees.hourly_rate` resilient → $15 fallback) + labor % with >30% alerts;
  Claude action narrative. `GET /intelligence/staffing`.
- `api.ts`: `intelligence.staffing` + `StaffingPlan`. InsightsPage Staffing tab (table + alerts).

### S5-03 — AI Menu Engineering ✅ COMPLETE
- `intelligence.service.getMenuEngineering`: 90-day per-product units + margin (price−cost), classified
  into Stars/Plowhorses/Puzzles/Dogs vs avg-units/avg-margin thresholds + per-class action + Claude
  narrative. `GET /intelligence/menu`.
- `api.ts`: `intelligence.menu` + `MenuEngineering`/`MenuClass`. InsightsPage Menu tab (4 quadrant cards).

### S5-04 — AI Food Cost Intelligence ✅ COMPLETE
- `intelligence.service.getFoodCostIntelligence`: overall food cost % (COGS from
  order_line_items.cost_price vs revenue, 30d), high-cost item list (flag >33%), auto **reorder
  draft** from inventory_levels ≤ reorder_point, + Claude action. `GET /intelligence/food-cost`.
- `api.ts`: `intelligence.foodCost` + `FoodCostIntelligence`. InsightsPage Food Cost tab
  (headline %, high-cost items, reorder draft).

### S5-05 — Daily Intelligence Feed ✅ COMPLETE
- `intelligence.service.getDailyFeed`: yesterday summary (sales/orders/avg/top item, tz day window) +
  aggregated alerts (food cost, reorder, labor, no-sales) + Claude morning briefing.
  `GET /intelligence/feed`; `POST /intelligence/feed/send` (SMS/email stub → logs).
- `api.ts`: `intelligence.feed/sendFeed` + `DailyFeed`. InsightsPage Daily Feed tab (default; briefing
  + yesterday cards + alerts, polls 5m, Send button).

### S5-06 — Enhanced AI Copilot ✅ COMPLETE
- `ai.routes.ts` nl-query: **fixed a latent bug** (queried non-existent `total_amount` / status
  `draft` → would 500). Now uses `total` / `parked`, adds top-products context, accepts conversation
  `history` (multi-turn), and returns `suggestedQuestions`.
- `api.ts`: `ai.nlQuery(query, locationId, history)` + `suggestedQuestions` on NLQueryResponse.
- InsightsPage Copilot tab: chat UI (history bubbles), suggested-question chips, data tables + bar
  charts from responses.

## ✅ Sprint 6 — Beta 2.0: Scale & Infrastructure (COMPLETE)

### S6-01 — Multi-Location ✅ COMPLETE
- `location.service.ts` (new): create/update/delete/list; createLocation grants access to
  owner/manager `location_ids`. Routes POST/PATCH/DELETE `/api/v1/locations` in settings.routes
  (GET already existed).
- `session.ts`: `getActiveLocationId`/`setActiveLocationId`; `getLocationId` now honors the switcher
  selection (localStorage `taproot_active_location`) → all client queries follow active location.
- `LocationSwitcher.tsx` (new) in POS sidebar (hidden when 1 location; reloads on switch).
- `LocationsSettingsPage.tsx` (new, `/settings/locations`): CRUD. `api.ts`: `locations.create/update/remove`.
- NOTE: cross-location report comparison lands in S6-05 (reporting suite). New-location WRITES may need
  a re-login so the JWT picks up the added location_id (reads work immediately).

### S6-02 — Offline Mode ✅ COMPLETE
- `offlineQueue.ts` (new): IndexedDB queue (enqueueOrder/getQueue/processQueue/pendingCount/
  clearSynced); replays create-order → process-payment on reconnect with real order numbers.
- `useOfflineSync.ts` (new): mirrors navigator.onLine → pos.store `isOffline`, auto-syncs on
  reconnect with toasts, polls pending count. Wired in POSLayout.
- POSLayout: red pulsing **offline banner**; existing SyncStatus shows queued count.
- PaymentSheet: when offline (cash/card) → enqueue + offline receipt snapshot (TEMP-xxxx), no API call.
- NOTE: queued card orders sync only where Stripe is configured; cash syncs everywhere.

### S6-03 — ESC/POS Printer Support ✅ COMPLETE
- `apps/print-server/` (new, standalone Node, no deps): ESC/POS bridge — `/health`,
  `/print/receipt`, `/print/kitchen`, `/drawer/open`; TCP:9100 to network printers or log mode.
  `docs/PRINT_SERVER.md` setup guide.
- `thermalPrint.ts` (new): detect server (configurable URL), `printReceiptThermal`/
  `printKitchenThermal`/`openCashDrawer`/`checkPrintServer`. ReceiptPage tries thermal → falls back to browser.
- `HardwareSettingsPage.tsx` (new, `/settings/hardware`): server status, URL, model, test print
  (+ barcode toggle for S6-04). Nav item.
- NOTE: print server runs on **3333** (prompt said 3001 = API port).

### S6-04 — Barcode Scanner Support ✅ COMPLETE
- Existing `useBarcode` (POS scan→add-to-cart) now gated on the Hardware scanner toggle.
- `useBarcodeScanner.ts` (new, generic, gates on `enabled` arg; default-on `getScannerEnabled`).
- ProductsSettingsPage modal: **Barcode field + "Scan to assign"** (arms a one-shot capture);
  `barcode` flows through product create/update.
- HardwareSettingsPage: scanner enable toggle (S6-03).
- NOTE: inventory scan→jump deferred — POS scan-lookup already covers finding products by barcode.

### S6-05 — Advanced Reporting Suite ✅ COMPLETE
- Report endpoints (sales/top-products/employee-perf/payment-methods/hourly-heatmap) + tabs
  (Dashboard/Sales/Products/Customers/Staff/Tips) already existed. Added:
  - **Heatmap tab** (`HeatmapTab.tsx`): 7×24 day×hour revenue grid, peak callout, CSV export.
  - **Cross-location filter** (S6-01 deliverable): "All Locations" + per-location dropdown in
    ReportsPage header → `apiParams.locationId` (omitted = org-wide).
- Menu engineering matrix lives in `/insights` (S5-03). CSV export present on Heatmap/EOD/Orders.

### S6-06 — QuickBooks Integration ✅ COMPLETE
- `integrations.routes.ts` (new, registered): `GET /integrations/export/:provider` (quickbooks|xero)
  → daily-sales CSV (Date/Description/Amount/Account/Tax) download (REPORTS_VIEW).
- `api.ts`: `integrations.exportCsv` (auth'd fetch → text). `IntegrationsSettingsPage.tsx` (new,
  `/settings/integrations`): date range + QuickBooks/Xero download + Mailchimp/Gusto/OpenTable/
  DoorDash "coming soon" stubs. Nav item.

## ✅ Sprint 7 — V1.0 Go-To-Market Polish (COMPLETE)

### S7-01 — AI Text Ordering ✅ COMPLETE
- `sms.service.ts` (Twilio REST via fetch, logs in dev) + `textOrdering.service.ts` (Claude parse →
  fuzzy product match → `createPublicOrder` pickup → SMS reply). `config.ts`: Twilio vars.
- `POST /webhook/sms/:orgSlug` (public, Twilio-signature checked, TwiML reply); urlencoded body parser
  added to Fastify. Online-ordering `textEnabled` opt-in toggle (UI + service requires `=== true`).

### S7-02 — Kiosk Mode ✅ COMPLETE
- `KioskPage.tsx` (new, `/kiosk`, RequireAuth): full-screen self-serve — category chips → product
  grid → cart → "Pay at Counter" (in_store order) → thank-you screen. Large touch targets, upsell
  prompt, 90s idle auto-reset (30s warning), 3-tap top-right + manager PIN (default 1234) to exit.
- HardwareSettingsPage: "Open Kiosk Mode" launcher. Uses authenticated product/order API.

### S7-03 — Onboarding Wizard Rewrite ✅ COMPLETE
- 7-step flow (was 6): Welcome → Menu Upload → Menu Review → **Add Team** → Connect Payments →
  **Tax Rate** → Complete. Replaced recipe step with team + tax.
- `onboarding.store.ts`: STEP_ORDER updated. New `TeamSetupStep.tsx` (add employees + PIN, skippable)
  and `TaxSetupStep.tsx` (state→auto-fill rate, saves via settings.saveTax). OnboardingPage rewired
  (labels, numbered steps, handlers). Progress/resume/skip retained.

### S7-04 — Landing Page ✅ COMPLETE
- `LandingPage.tsx`: V1.0 hero ("reads your menu and sets itself up"), social-proof bar,
  feature grid (kept), **Toast/Square/Taproot comparison table**, "8 hours vs 10 minutes" line,
  **FAQ** (hardware/import/data/setup fee), pricing + footer retained.

### S7-05 — Error Monitoring + Analytics ✅ COMPLETE
- `lib/logger.ts` (api): structured JSON logger (timestamp/level/message/context). Process-level
  `unhandledRejection`/`uncaughtException` handlers in index.ts (log, no silent crash).
- `ErrorBoundary.tsx` (web): friendly recovery page + refresh; wraps App in main.tsx.
- Already present: `/api/health` (status/version/uptime/checks/timestamp), Plausible analytics
  (index.html + analytics.ts track→window.plausible), Sentry init.

### S7-06 — Performance + Polish Pass ✅ COMPLETE
- Audit: favicon (🌿 green SVG) + PWA manifest ("Taproot POS", theme #1D9E75, all 8 icons present)
  verified; production `vite build` green (PWA SW + 16 precache entries).
- New Sprint 4–7 pages confirmed to follow patterns: loading skeletons, empty states (Customers/
  Discounts/Locations/Insights/Gift Cards), `h-screen overflow-hidden` + `flex-1 overflow-y-auto
  min-h-0` scroll, ErrorBoundary now catches render errors app-wide.

## 🐛 Open Bugs — Fix These First

### P0 — Blocks core usage

| Bug ID | Symptom | File | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **BUG-PAY-001** | "Cannot read properties of undefined (reading 'length')" after clicking Charge | `PaymentSheet.tsx` — `buildReceiptSnapshot()`, `item.modifiers ?? []` and `items?.map(...) ?? []` safe fallbacks needed; also check `CartItem.modifiers` defaults in `pos.store.ts` | ✅ RESOLVED (Prompt 27) |

### P1 — Degrades experience

| Bug ID | Symptom | File | Status |
|---|---|---|---|
| **BUG-IMP-001** | CSV uploads OK but review screen shows empty item list | `importJob.service.ts` — CSV parsing path in `processImportJob` | OPEN |
| **BUG-IMP-002** | PDF menu import gives $0.00 for all prices | `documentParser.service.ts` — `parseMenu` prompt / cents extraction | OPEN |
| **BUG-IMP-003** | Import review screen overflows viewport; must zoom out to reach buttons | `ImportReview.tsx` — layout/height CSS | OPEN |
| **BUG-IMP-004** | Import workflow stops at review; confirm button doesn't push to POS | `ImportReview.tsx` + `importJob.service.ts` — confirm flow end-to-end | OPEN |

### P3 — Low priority (future)

| Bug ID | Symptom | Status |
|---|---|---|
| BUG-QA-011 | MFA enforcement UI step missing (LoginPage.tsx TODO) | OPEN |
| BUG-QA-012 | "+" in CustomerSearch doesn't open create modal | ✅ RESOLVED (S4-06) |
| BUG-QA-013 | No UI to set tax rate (tax_config JSONB exists but no settings page) | ✅ RESOLVED (S1-04) |
| BUG-QA-014 | Top customers report empty (seed orders have customer_id = NULL) | OPEN |

## 📋 Pending Migrations (Railway Console)

Migrations 001–013 are applied on Railway (011/012/013 confirmed live during S1-08 verification).
**Pending: 014_employee_hourly_rate** — run when convenient:
```bash
# In Railway service console:
npx node-pg-migrate up --migrations-dir migrations
```
Code degrades gracefully until 014 runs (employee.service column-existence guard).

## 🗺️ Next Prompts Queue (27–30)

### Prompt 27 — Item modifier sheet ✅ COMPLETE
- **BUG-PAY-001 RESOLVED**: `(c.modifiers ?? []).map(...)` in both receipt snapshot builder and order create body in PaymentSheet.tsx
- Backend: `buildProductWithRelations` in `product.service.ts` now fetches modifier groups + options via single SQL query with `JSON_AGG`; new types `ModifierGroupData`, `ModifierOptionData`, `ProductWithModifiers`
- Frontend `api.ts`: `ProductWithModifiers` type; `products.list()` includes `modifierGroups` from API; `ProductListResponse` updated
- `ModifierSheet.tsx`: added `minSelections`, `maxSelections`, `sortOrder`, `isDefault` to types; pre-selects default modifiers; "Add to Order" label
- `POSLayout.tsx`: `handleProductTap` checks `modifierGroups.length > 0`; if yes → opens ModifierSheet; if no → fast path direct add; `handleProductLongPress` always opens sheet; cart display shows modifiers as indented sub-lines with price deltas
- **Demo**: Tap "Classic Burger" → modifier sheet opens; tap "Draft Beer" → adds instantly

### Prompt 28 — Archive/Seasonal Items ✅ COMPLETE
Three-state product model: Active / Archived / Deleted.
- **PRODUCT STATE RULE**: every POS query must filter `deleted_at IS NULL AND archived_at IS NULL`
- `migrations/012_product_archive.js`: `archived_at TIMESTAMPTZ`, `archive_reason VARCHAR(255)`, `archived_by UUID→employees` + partial GIN index
  ⚠️ Needs `npx node-pg-migrate up --migrations-dir migrations` on Railway
- `product.service.ts`: state rule comment, `archived_at IS NULL` added to `listProducts` + barcode search; new exports `archiveProduct`, `restoreProduct`, `listArchivedProducts`, `ArchivedProductRow`
- `inventory.routes.ts`: `GET /products/archived`, `POST /products/:id/archive`, `POST /products/:id/restore`
- `api.ts`: `products.archive()`, `products.restore()`, `products.listArchived()`, `ArchivedProductRow` type
- `InventoryPage.tsx`: 5th tab "Archived" (Archive icon)
- `ArchivedProducts.tsx` (new): archived items table with name/category/price/date/reason; Restore button; "Delete permanently" stub
- `StockLevels.tsx`: Archive icon per row → confirmation dialog with optional reason; removes row from list on success
- `ModifierSheet.tsx`: `onArchive?` prop + Archive icon in header (amber on hover)
- `POSLayout.tsx`: `handleArchiveFromPOS` → `window.confirm` → archive + invalidate queries + close sheet
- `docs/ARCHITECTURE.md` (new): canonical query pattern, state table, day-part rule, auth/cart patterns

**Demo**: Inventory → Stock Levels → Classic Burger → Archive icon → enter reason → POS no longer shows it → Inventory → Archived → Restore → back on POS

### Prompt 29 — Dashboard Layout Editor ✅ COMPLETE
Fixes BUG-NAV-001 (non-uniform tiles, no color/order control).

- `migrations/013_org_settings.js`: adds `settings JSONB` to organizations table
  ⚠️ Needs `npx node-pg-migrate up --migrations-dir migrations` on Railway
- `settings.routes.ts` (new): `GET /api/v1/settings/dashboard-layout` reads from
  `organizations.settings->'dashboardLayout'`; `PATCH` uses `jsonb_set` to store
- `index.ts`: registers `settingsRoutes`
- `api.ts`: `DashboardLayout`, `CategoryLayoutConfig`, `DEFAULT_DASHBOARD_LAYOUT`
  types; `settings.getDashboardLayout` / `saveDashboardLayout` API methods
- `layout.store.ts` (new): Zustand persist store; `fetchLayout()`, `saveLayout()`,
  `resetLayout()`; persists to `taproot-dashboard-layout` localStorage key
- `CategoryTileGrid.tsx` rewrite: **BUG-NAV-001 fixed** — all tiles now `aspect-square`
  (uniform size); reads `useLayoutStore`; applies color/icon/order/hidden/pinned from
  config; respects `gridColumns` (2/3/4); safe-default rule (null layout → original behavior)
- `DashboardEditorPage.tsx` (new): `/settings/dashboard` — live preview (left 55%) +
  sortable category list (right 45%); drag-to-reorder via `@dnd-kit/sortable` (touch
  + mouse); `ColorPicker` (10 presets + hex input); `IconPicker` (20 food emojis);
  pin/hide per category; grid columns selector; All Items tile toggle + color; Save / Reset
- `App.tsx`: `/settings/dashboard` route (RequireAuth)
- `POSLayout.tsx`: "Customize" nav item → `/settings/dashboard`
- Installed: `@dnd-kit/core`, `@dnd-kit/sortable`, `@dnd-kit/utilities`

**Demo**: POS → sidebar Customize → change Classic Burger to red + 🍔 icon → drag Food to top → Save → POS tiles update immediately

### Prompt 30 — Beta 1.0 Bug Fixes ✅ COMPLETE
All P0 + P1 bugs resolved (commit 2dbace5):
- BUG-PAY-001: already fixed (Prompt 27), BACKLOG.md updated
- BUG-IMP-001: CSV full records stored in mappingConfig.parsed.records; GenericImportReview reads them
- BUG-IMP-002: normalizeMenuPrice() added — values < 100 multiplied × 100; prompt updated with examples
- BUG-IMP-003: ImportPage h-screen overflow-hidden + flex-1 min-h-0 card; GenericImportReview min-h-0
- BUG-IMP-004: case 'generic_csv': added to confirmImportJob switch; applyGenericCsvImport() implemented
- BUG-UX-001/002: InventoryPage h-screen overflow-hidden; <main> overflow-y-auto min-h-0
- BUG-NAV-001: already fixed (Prompt 29), BACKLOG.md updated

## ✅ Sprint 1 COMPLETE — Beta 1.1 (tag v0.2.0-beta-1.1)
All 8 prompts done (S1-01…S1-08). New `/settings` area: Products, Categories, Modifiers,
Employees (+ PIN login lock screen), Business (configurable tax — resolves BUG-QA-013),
Payments, plus the Dashboard editor. New backend: category/modifier/employee services + routes,
business/tax/receipt/payments settings endpoints, `/auth/pin-login`, `/api/v1/locations`.
Live-verified S1-08: product create (default variant+price), tax round-trip, all routes 401-gated,
employees/selectable 200. Only migration 014 (hourly_rate) pending; code degrades gracefully.

## ✅ Sprint 3 — Beta 1.3: Table Service (COMPLETE)

### S3-01 — Floor Plan Editor ✅ COMPLETE
- `table.service.ts` + `table.routes.ts` (new, registered): GET/POST/PATCH/DELETE `/tables`,
  PATCH `/tables/bulk-positions` (declared before `:id`). Uses existing `tables` table (001).
- `api.ts`: `tables.*` + `TableRow`/`TableInput`/`TableShape`.
- `FloorPlanEditorPage.tsx` (new, `/settings/floor-plan`): dotted 20px grid canvas, pointer-based
  drag-to-move (snap) + corner resize, select + properties panel (name/seats/section/shape),
  add/delete, undo/redo (20-deep, positions), deterministic section colors, Save → bulk-positions.
- `SettingsLayout`: Floor Plan nav item. `App.tsx`: `/settings/floor-plan` route.

### S3-02 — Table Service POS Mode ✅ COMPLETE
- `table.service.ts`: `getTableStatus` (tables + current open order via LATERAL join: itemCount,
  total, minutesOpen), `assignOrderToTable`. Routes `GET /tables/status`, `PATCH /orders/:id/table`.
- `api.ts`: `tables.status/assignOrder` + `TableStatus`; `tableId` on `OrderCreateBody` (orderType
  defaults to 'table_service' when a table is set); create transform passes tableId.
- `TableView.tsx` (new): read-only floor plan, green=available/amber=occupied, section tabs, polls
  10s. Tap available → `setTable` + switch to grid; tap occupied → toast order summary.
- `POSLayout`: Grid/Table toggle in top bar; renders TableView in table mode. PaymentSheet +
  SplitCheckModal send `tableId` (clearCart already resets it).
- NOTE: "Move table" reassignment UI deferred (endpoint exists). Occupied-table tap shows summary
  rather than loading the order into the cart (quick-service cart model).

### S3-03 — QR Code Ordering ✅ COMPLETE
- `public.service.ts` + `public.routes.ts` (new, NO auth — keys added to PUBLIC_ROUTES, registered
  before auth plugin): `GET /public/:slug/menu`, `POST /public/:slug/order`, `GET /public/:slug/order/:id/status`.
  Online orders attributed to a system employee (prefer owner), orderType 'online', fires realtime event.
- `settings.routes.ts`: GET /settings/business now returns `orgSlug`.
- `api.ts`: `publicApi.menu/createOrder/orderStatus` (uses `/public` base, no JWT); `orgSlug` on BusinessSettings.
- `PublicMenuPage.tsx` (new, routes `/order/:slug` + `/order/:slug/table/:tableId`, no auth): branded menu,
  cart, checkout (name/phone), place order (pay at counter), confirmation w/ order # + ETA.
- `QrCodesSettingsPage.tsx` (new, `/settings/qr-codes`): per-table + general-menu QR via
  api.qrserver.com (no dependency), PNG download, Print all. QR Codes nav item.
- `OnlineOrdersBell.tsx` (new) in POS top bar: polls history 15s, badges open online orders, toasts on new.
- NOTE deferred: Stripe "Pay Now" (pay-at-counter only), modifiers on public menu, PDF-all (print used).

### S3-04 — Kitchen Display System ✅ COMPLETE
- `kitchen.service.ts` + `kitchen.routes.ts` (new, registered): GET `/kitchen/tickets`,
  PATCH `/kitchen/items/:itemId/ready`, PATCH `/kitchen/orders/:orderId/bump`. Kitchen state stored
  in `orders.metadata.kitchen` ({ readyItems[], bumpedAt }) — NO migration. Bumped orders drop off.
- `api.ts`: `kitchen.tickets/itemReady/bump` + types.
- `KitchenDisplayPage.tsx` (new, `/kitchen`): dark full-screen, polls 5s, ticket cards w/ elapsed
  color (green<5/amber5-10/red>10 flashing), tap item → ready (strikethrough), BUMP (green when all
  ready), large-text mode. Kitchen nav item in POS sidebar.
- NOTE: stations deferred (no station config — all items station 'all').

### S3-05 — Reservations & Waitlist ✅ COMPLETE
- `migrations/016_reservations.js` ⚠️ NEEDS RAILWAY MIGRATION (prompt called it "014"; renumbered
  to 016 since 014/015 were used this sprint).
- `reservation.service.ts` (resilient) + `reservation.routes.ts` (registered): list/create/update/
  delete + `/:id/notify` (Twilio stub → logs when unconfigured) + `/:id/seat`.
- `api.ts`: `reservations.*` + types.
- `ReservationsPage.tsx` (new, `/reservations`): Waitlist | Reservations tabs (date picker for
  reservations), add modal, notify, seat (table prompt), remove. Reservations nav item in POS.

## ✅ Sprint 2 COMPLETE — Beta 1.2 (tag v0.3.0-beta-1.2)
Order History, Void/Refund, Tips, Cash Drawer, End-of-Day, Split Check. **Found + fixed
BUG-ORD-001** (P0): the POS order-create body shape didn't match the backend, so live cash/card
order creation 500'd — `orders.create` now translates items→lineItems + orderType. Live-verified:
full create→pay(+tip)→void lifecycle, all Sprint 2 endpoints 200, resilience fixes (employees,
cash-drawer) confirmed in prod. Migrations 014 + 015 still pending on Railway (code degrades
gracefully).

## ✅ Sprint 2 — Beta 1.2: Transaction Management (COMPLETE)

### S2-01 — Order History Screen ✅ COMPLETE
- `order.service.ts`: `listOrderHistory()` — org-wide enriched list (employee + customer name,
  payment methods via STRING_AGG, line-item count); `OrderHistoryFilter`/`OrderHistoryRow`.
- `order.routes.ts`: `GET /api/v1/orders` (ORDER_VIEW; cashiers restricted to own orders).
- `api.ts`: `orders.history()` + `OrderHistoryRow`.
- `OrderHistoryPage.tsx` (new, route `/orders`): date-preset/status/employee/payment/search
  filters, CSV export, table, right detail drawer (line items, payments, totals) via existing
  receipt endpoint; drawer body is `.receipt-content` so Print works.
- `App.tsx`: `/orders` → OrderHistoryPage (replaced placeholder). `POSLayout`: Orders nav item.
- NOTE: void/refund buttons added in S2-02.

### S2-02 — Void & Refund ✅ COMPLETE
- `transaction.service.ts` (new): `voidOrder` (works on completed orders — distributes full
  refund across payments via existing `PaymentSvc.refundPayment` (Stripe + gift-card aware),
  voids line items, sets status='voided'); `refundOrder` (full/partial/by-item; by-item sums
  selected line totals); `listOrderLineItems`.
- `order.routes.ts`: `POST /orders/:id/void` (ORDER_VOID), `POST /orders/:id/refund` (ORDER_REFUND),
  `GET /orders/:id/line-items`.
- `api.ts`: `orders.voidOrder/refund/lineItems`.
- `OrderActions.tsx` (new): Void modal (reason dropdown, "cannot be undone") + Refund modal
  (Full/Partial/By-item tabs, reason, live preview). Wired into OrderHistoryPage drawer.
- NOTE: manager-PIN override for cashiers DEFERRED — access gated by ORDER_VOID/ORDER_REFUND
  permissions instead (cashiers without them get 403).

### S2-03 — Tip Management ✅ COMPLETE
- `payment.service.ts`: `processPayment` now sets `orders.tip_total` and computes change_due /
  fullyPaid from `amount` ONLY (tips no longer counted as change). Fixed double-count bug.
- `PaymentSheet.tsx`: tip UI already existed; now sends `amount: total()` (excl tip) +
  `tipAmount` separately (was sending tip-inclusive amount → double count).
- `transaction.service.ts`: `adjustTip` (manager post-payment tip adjust on latest payment +
  recompute order tip_total/amount_paid). Route `POST /orders/:id/adjust-tip` (ORDER_REFUND).
- `reporting.service.ts`: `getTipsReport` (by day / employee / payment method + avg tip %).
  Route `GET /reports/tips`. `reports.getTips` + `TipsReportData` in api.ts.
- `TipsTab.tsx` (new) added to ReportsPage (6th tab "Tips": summary cards, by-day chart,
  by-employee + by-method tables).

### S2-04 — Cash Drawer Management ✅ COMPLETE
- `migrations/015_cash_drawer.js` ⚠️ NEEDS RAILWAY MIGRATION (cash_drawer_sessions + cash_drops,
  one-open-per-location partial unique index; money in integer cents/bigint).
- `cashDrawer.service.ts` (new, resilient to pending migration): open/drop/close/getCurrent/
  history. Expected = opening + cash sales − cash refunds − drops (computed from payments).
- `cashDrawer.routes.ts` (new, registered): /cash-drawer/current|history|open|drop|close.
- `api.ts`: `cashDrawer.*`. `CashDrawerWidget.tsx` (new) in POS cart panel — open/drop/close
  modals + live expected; close shows discrepancy.
- NOTE: no-sale button deferred.

### S2-05 — End of Day Report ✅ COMPLETE
- `reporting.service.ts`: `getEndOfDayReport(orgId, date, locationId?, tz)` — tz-aware day window;
  gross/refunds/net/orders/avg ticket, tax, tips, by-payment-method, top 5 items, by-employee,
  hourly breakdown, cash reconciliation (from that day's drawer session; resilient if 015 absent).
  Careful param indexing (location=$4, tz appended per-query) to avoid the $N-type-infer trap.
- `report.routes.ts`: `GET /reports/end-of-day?date=YYYY-MM-DD&location_id&timezone`.
- `api.ts`: `reports.getEndOfDay` + `EndOfDayReport`.
- `EndOfDayPage.tsx` (new, route `/reports/end-of-day`): date picker, summary cards, payment/hourly,
  top items, employees, cash reconciliation; Print (.receipt-content) / CSV / Email(stub).
- `ReportsPage`: prominent "End of Day" button.

### S2-06 — Split Check ✅ COMPLETE
- No backend change needed — the order model already accepts multiple payments (amount_paid
  accumulates). `SplitCheckModal.tsx` (new) creates the order once on first charge, then
  processes each split as a separate `payments.process` call (cash/card per split). On full
  settlement → receipt snapshot → /receipt.
- Modes: Split Evenly (2–8 ways, remainder spread to first shares) + Custom Amounts (must sum
  to total). "Split check" button added under Charge in the cart panel.
- NOTE: By-item split deferred (even + custom shipped).
- CAVEAT: card splits use the real payment API like the rest of the app — needs Stripe Connect
  in production; cash splits work everywhere.

## Sprint 1 Queue — Beta 1.1: Settings & Admin
See full roadmap at docs/ROADMAP.md

### Prompt 31 (S1-01) — Product Management UI ✅ COMPLETE
Full product create/edit/delete at /settings/products.
- `product.service.ts`: `createProduct` now also creates a "Default" variant + active
  `product_prices` row (price in cents) so new products are immediately sellable;
  `CreateProductData.price` + `UpdateProductData.price` added; updateProduct expires/
  re-inserts the default-variant price; createProduct now persists `day_parts`.
- `api.ts`: `products.create()`, `products.remove()`, `CreateProductBody`, `day_parts` on
  `ProductWithModifiers`.
- `session.ts` (new): shared `getLocationId`/`getStoredUser`/`getCurrentRole`/`canAccessSettings`.
- `SettingsLayout.tsx` (new): settings shell (sidebar + mobile tab bar + permission guard + Outlet).
- `ProductsSettingsPage.tsx` (new): search/category/status filters, table w/ stock status from
  inventory levels, create/edit modal (day-part chips, track-inventory/active toggles), archive/
  restore/delete actions.
- `App.tsx`: nested `/settings` → SettingsLayout with `/settings/products` child; index → products.

### Prompt 36 (S1-06) — Settings Shell + Navigation ✅ COMPLETE
/settings/categories — create/edit/delete, drag-to-reorder, color/icon picker, product count.
- `category.service.ts` (new): createCategory, updateCategory, deleteCategory (detaches products
  → category_id NULL, then soft-delete), reorderCategories.
- `inventory.routes.ts`: POST/PATCH/DELETE `/api/v1/categories` + PATCH `/categories/reorder`
  (declared before `:id`); GET /categories now also selects `c.icon`.
- `api.ts`: `categories.create/update/remove/reorder`, `CategoryInput`/`CategoryRow`, `icon` on
  `CategoryWithCount`.
- `CategoriesSettingsPage.tsx` (new): @dnd-kit sortable rows, color palette + hex + Auto, emoji
  icon picker + "use initials", product counts; reorder persists + invalidates layout store.
- `App.tsx`: `/settings/categories` route.

### Prompt 36 (S1-06) — Settings Shell + Navigation ✅ COMPLETE
/settings/modifiers — full CRUD groups + options + product assignment.
- `modifier.service.ts` (new): listModifierGroups (groups + modifiers[] + productIds via JSON_AGG),
  create/update/delete group (soft-delete cascades modifiers + clears assignments), add/update/
  delete modifier, setGroupProducts, setProductGroups.
- `modifier.routes.ts` (new, registered in index.ts): /modifier-groups CRUD, /:id/modifiers,
  /:id/products, /modifiers/:id, /products/:id/modifier-groups.
- `api.ts`: `modifiers.*` client + `ModifierGroupFull`/`ModifierItem`/`ModifierSelectionType`.
- `ModifiersSettingsPage.tsx` (new): accordion groups, inline add/edit/reorder(↑↓)/delete options,
  default toggle, price delta ($, negative ok), product-assignment checkboxes (pre-checked).
- `App.tsx`: `/settings/modifiers` route.
- NOTE: modifier reorder uses ↑/↓ buttons (persists sort_order) rather than drag.

### Prompt 36 (S1-06) — Settings Shell + Navigation ✅ COMPLETE
/settings/business — General | Tax | Receipt | Hours tabs. **Resolves BUG-QA-013.**
- TAX: server-side `calculateTax` already read `locations.tax_config` (BUG-QA-005); the 8.5%
  was only a frontend cart-preview estimate in `pos.store.ts`. Now configurable.
- `settings.routes.ts`: GET/PATCH `/settings/business` (org name + settings.businessProfile
  website/logo + location name/address/phone/timezone/currency), GET/PATCH `/settings/tax`
  (writes `tax_config.rates[{name,rate,included,appliesTo}]`), GET/PATCH `/settings/receipt`
  (locations.receipt_config). `resolveLocationId` helper picks the requested/first org location.
- `pos.store.ts`: module-level `setPosTaxRate`/`getPosTaxRate`; `taxTotal` now uses it on
  (subtotal − discount). Default still 8.5% until settings load.
- `POSLayout.tsx`: loads `/settings/tax`, calls `setPosTaxRate`, label shows live rate.
  `MobileCart.tsx` label uses `getPosTaxRate()`.
- `api.ts`: `settings.getBusiness/saveBusiness/getTax/saveTax/getReceipt/saveReceipt`,
  `auth.changePassword` (→ existing `POST /auth/password/change`).
- `BusinessSettingsPage.tsx` (new): General (org/location/address/tz/currency + change password),
  Tax (rate list + inclusive toggle + live preview + empty warning), Receipt (message/footer +
  show toggles), Hours (placeholder — note below).
- `App.tsx`: `/settings/business` route.
- NOTE: Hours tab is a placeholder; no business-hours backend yet (logged for a later prompt).

### Prompt 36 (S1-06) — Settings Shell + Navigation ✅ COMPLETE
/settings/employees — add/edit/deactivate, PIN, location assignment, hourly rate.
- `migrations/014_employee_hourly_rate.js` ⚠️ NEEDS RAILWAY MIGRATION.
- `employee.service.ts` (new): list/create/update/delete (soft, revokes tokens, blocks last
  owner + self-deactivate)/resetPin/listSelectableEmployees. New staff get a random unusable
  password_hash (PIN-only). PIN 4–6 digits, bcrypt-hashed.
- `employee.routes.ts` (new): /employees CRUD (owner/manager guard) + /:id/reset-pin +
  /employees/selectable (any authed session, minimal fields for lock screen).
- `auth/routes.ts`: new `POST /auth/pin-login` — device-session PIN switch (terminal already
  authenticated → select employee + PIN → fresh full session). Reuses completeLogin.
- `settings.routes.ts`: `GET /api/v1/locations` (org locations for pickers).
- `api.ts`: `employees.*`, `locations.list`, `auth.pinLogin`, types.
- `EmployeesSettingsPage.tsx` (new): list + add/edit modal (role, PIN show/hide, hourly rate,
  location chips), reset-PIN, deactivate.
- `EmployeeSelect.tsx` (new): full-screen lock screen — employee avatar grid → PIN pad
  (keyboard + touch), shake on wrong PIN, 3-attempt lock, "use password instead"; on success
  stores new tokens+user and reloads. Wired into POSLayout via "Switch user" + 5-min idle.
- `animations.css`: `animate-shake`.
- Transaction employee attribution is server-side via JWT (order.service uses user.sub).
- NOTE: order attribution already correct via JWT; pos.store loggedInEmployeeId not needed.

### Prompt 36 (S1-06) — Settings Shell + Navigation ✅ COMPLETE
Shell was built in S1-01 (`SettingsLayout.tsx`): desktop sidebar + mobile horizontal tab bar,
`canAccessSettings()` permission guard (cashier/kitchen/readonly → redirect to / with toast),
`/settings` index → `/settings/products`, `<Outlet/>` for nested pages. POSLayout Settings nav →
`/settings`. This prompt added the `/settings/payments` route + stub page so all 7 nav links
resolve (Products, Categories, Modifiers, Employees, Business, Payments, Dashboard).

### Prompt 37 (S1-07) — Payments Settings ✅ COMPLETE
/settings/payments — full page (replaced S1-06 stub).
- Reuses existing `GET /payments/connect/status`, `POST /payments/connect/account`,
  `POST /payments/connect/refresh-link`. Status 400s when no account → client catches → null
  → "Not connected".
- `settings.routes.ts`: GET/PATCH `/settings/payments` (org settings.paymentMethods; cash forced on).
- `api.ts`: `settings.getPayments/savePayments`, `stripeConnect.status/start/refreshLink`.
- `PaymentsSettingsPage.tsx`: Connect status card (masked account, payouts, manage link / connect
  button), payment-method toggles (cash locked on; card/wallets gated on Stripe), fee display.

### Prompt 37b — (was S1-07, now done above)

### Prompt 37 (S1-08) — Sprint 1 Integration Test + Deploy
Full walkthrough all settings screens, fix bugs, tag v0.2.0-beta-1.1.

## NEXT PROMPT
V1.0 shipped (all 7 sprints complete). No queued prompt — Jake-driven from here.

## IMPORTANT: Pending Railway Migrations
None. Migrations 001–016 are all applied on Railway (verified live). No pending migrations.

## Demo Day Scenario (use for testing)
After completing Sprint 1:
1. Settings → Business → set tax rate to 8.875% (NYC rate)
2. Settings → Products → add "Seasonal Salad" at $16.99
3. Settings → Employees → add "Maria" with cashier role + PIN 2468
4. POS → select Maria → PIN → complete sale → verify Maria tracked in reports

## Key Schema Facts (Ground Truth — Do Not Guess)

### Products table
- `products.is_active boolean NOT NULL DEFAULT true`
- `products.day_parts varchar(50)[] DEFAULT NULL` — null/empty = visible all day; non-empty restricts to those meal periods (additive filter: `IS NULL OR = '{}' OR 'x' = ANY(day_parts)`)
- `products.product_type` CHECK: `standard|recipe|bundle|service|weight`
- `products.unit_of_measure` CHECK: `each|g|kg|ml|l|oz|lb|m|ft`

### Employees table
- **NO `is_active` column** — uses `deleted_at` for soft-delete
- **NO `employee_locations` junction table** — uses `location_ids uuid[]` array directly
- Roles CHECK: `owner|manager|cashier|kitchen|readonly`

### Other key facts
- `employees.name` column does NOT exist — use `first_name || ' ' || last_name`
- `locations.tax_config` JSONB: `{rates: [{name, rate, included}]}` — no `tax_rates` table
- `order_line_items` (not `order_items`), `product_prices` (not `prices`)
- `orders.order_type` CHECK: `in_store|takeout|delivery|table_service|online|phone` (NOT dine_in)
- `recipes` keyed by `product_id` (not variant_id), has `yield_factor`, `version`, `is_active`, `deleted_at`
- `recipe_lines`: `ingredient_product_id` + `ingredient_variant_id`
- `purchase_orders.status` CHECK: `draft|sent|confirmed|partially_received|received|cancelled`
- `inventory_levels` uses two partial unique indexes (variant_id NULL vs NOT NULL)
- Org plan CHECK: `trial|starter|growth|enterprise`

### Verified demo account
- Email: `demo@taproot.pos` | Password: `TaprootDemo2026!`
- Role: owner | 22 products | All product `day_parts` = NULL (always visible)

---

## Key Web Patterns

- `TOKEN_KEY`/`REFRESH_TOKEN_KEY`/`USER_KEY` in localStorage; token decoded for locationId
- `VITE_API_URL=""` → relative URL → Vite proxy → `http://localhost:3001`
- `usePOSStore.getState()` for imperative access outside React
- `useUIStore` for sidebar collapse + POS view mode + activeDayPart (none persisted except sidebarCollapsed)
- `apiFetch` options: `{ noRedirect: true }` for optional calls (e.g. TrialBanner billing check)
- `PUBLIC_PATHS` guard in apiFetch 401 handler — never hard-redirects from `/register` or `/login`
- Receipt state: `lastCompletedOrder` in pos.store — NOT persisted; navigate to `/receipt` on payment success
- Day-part filter: ADDITIVE — `null/empty day_parts` = always visible regardless of toggle

---

## Key API Patterns

### Products
- `GET /api/v1/products?dayPart=lunch` — additive filter; omit or `all` for no filter
- `PATCH /api/v1/products/:id` — accepts `{ dayParts: string[] | null }` to set meal periods
- `GET /api/v1/categories` — returns `{ categories: CategoryWithCount[] }` with `product_count`
- `GET /api/v1/orders/:orderId/receipt` — returns full `Receipt` (org name, location, line items, payments)

### Auth
- Login resolves org from email (no slug needed)
- `POST /api/v1/register` — returns `{ accessToken, refreshToken, employee, org, location, trialDays }`

- `categoryColors.ts`: deterministic hash → color from 10-color palette
- `POSLayout.tsx` rewrite: collapsible sidebar (`w-48`↔`w-14`, `transition-all`); category tile → item view with breadcrumb; search auto-switches to item view
- Backend: `GET /api/v1/categories` now includes `product_count` via LEFT JOIN

### Prompt 26 — Day-Part Toggle (Breakfast / Brunch / Lunch / Dinner) ✅
**Additive filtering**: products with no `day_parts` are ALWAYS visible.
- `migrations/011_day_parts.js`: `day_parts varchar(50)[]` + GIN index (⚠️ needs `npx node-pg-migrate up` on Railway)
- `DayPartToggle.tsx`: compact emoji pill toggle in POS search bar
- `ui.store.ts`: `activeDayPart` (NOT persisted — always 'all' on page load)
- `ProductDetailSheet.tsx`: "When to show on register" checkboxes (Inventory → product → edit)
- **Demo**: Inventory → Classic Burger → check Lunch+Dinner → POS Breakfast mode → burger disappears

## Security Constraints (Preserved)

- All Stripe keys from environment only
- Offline card data encrypted AES-256-GCM — never plaintext in Redis
- Webhook signature verification — reject unsigned with 400
- Idempotency keys on all Stripe API calls: `taproot-{orgId}-{orderId}-{timestamp}`
- Card numbers never logged, never in DB — only last4 + brand stored
- Migration wizard UI: "Your credentials are used only for this import and are never stored"
